# mTRFpy - multivariate linear modeling

This is an adaptation of the matlab mTRF-toolbox using only basic Python and Numpy.
It aims to implement the same methods as the original toolbox and advance them.
This documentation provides tutorial-like demonstrations of the core functionalities like model fitting, visualization and optimization as well as a comprehensive reference documentation.

# News
- [2025.10.13] ðŸ”§ Version 2.1.1 has been released for fixing the bug when fs is provided as a native int. A native int causes the array-api-compat.floor/ceil throw the error that fs doesn't have the attribute 'dtype'.
- [2025.10.11] ðŸš€ Version 2.1.0 has been released! mTRFpy is now compatible with the Array API standard through [array-api-compat](https://github.com/data-apis/array-api-compat). âœ¨ **New feature**: Support for fitting a separate regularization parameter for each output channel.

# Installation

You can get the stable release from PyPI:
```sh
    pip install mtrf 
```
    
Or get the latest version from this repo:
```sh
    pip install git+https://github.com/powerfulbean/mTRFpy.git
```

While mTRFpy only depends on numpy, matplotlib is an optional dependency used to
visualize models. It can also be installed via pip:

```sh
    pip install matplotlib
```

We also provide an optional interface to MNE-Python so it might be useful to [install mne](https://mne.tools/stable/install/manual_install.html) as well.

# Getting started
